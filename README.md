# Dual-STF
**Dual-STF: Learning Multi-Scale Semantic‚ÄìTemporal Representations via Dual-Pathway Fusion for Time Series Anomaly Detection**

This codebase provides an implementation of Dual-STF, a novel dual-path collaborative framework for multi-variable time series anomaly detection. Dual-STF integrates a frequency-enhanced temporal reconstruction path and a semantically guided structural modeling path to collaboratively perceive multimodal anomaly features, significantly enhancing detection robustness and generalization capabilities.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **SMAP**, **MSL**, and **SMD** datasets were obtained from the [OmniAnomaly repository](https://github.com/NetManAIOps/OmniAnomaly).
- **SWaT** dataset was obtained from the [TranAD repository](https://github.com/imperial-qore/TranAD).
- **PSM** dataset was obtained from the [DualTF repository](https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/DualTF).

Before running the code, please make sure the datasets are organized as expected under the corresponding directory (e.g., `./data/`). For proprietary reasons, the dataset loader component is not included in the public release. In order to maintain the integrity of the interface, the relevant code interface is still retained, and users can implement the loading code themselves based on the public data and interface specifications.
